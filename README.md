# Getting Started

From root directory run:
```
./manage up
```

Navigate to [researcher notebook](http://localhost:8889), you will find the token for this in the terminal you ran ./manage up from.

Navigate to [data notebook](http://localhost:8888), you will find the token for this in the terminal you ran ./manage up from.

Both jupyter instances should have a notebook, either researcher or data_owner. Open these up and follow the tutorial contained within the notebooks. You can view these notebooks from this repo in the demo folder.
