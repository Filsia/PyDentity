    "# Secure Multi-Party Voting\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook,\n",
    "we explore a voting protocol which uses secure multi-party computation (SMPC)\n",
    "to aggregate votes,\n",
    "without individual votes being discoverable.\n",
    "This protocol is best suited to a voting session with well-defined,\n",
    "non-cooperating parties,\n",
    "such as political parties in a general election.\n",
    "Each party is given a share of a vote,\n",
    "and computes a sum over their shares.\n",
    "Finally,\n",
    "parties combine their encrypted shares and decrypt it\n",
    "to reveal the final vote.\n",
    "Please read [this PySyft tutorial](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/master/examples/tutorials/Part%2009%20-%20Intro%20to%20Encrypted%20Programs.ipynb)\n",

    "### Assumptions of this protocol:\n",
    "- Limited, well-defined vote options\n",
    "    - Vote values (e.g. \"PryVote\") must be converted into an integer to be shared between parties. To assign each vote value to an integer, we need to know how many possible vote values there are ahead of time\n",
    "- Majority vote scheme\n",
    "    - Quadratic voting not supported\n",
    "    - \"multi-vote\" schemes, such as STV, not supported"
